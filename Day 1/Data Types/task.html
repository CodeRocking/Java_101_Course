<h1>Lab 2: Data Types and Variables</h1>
<h2>What Can You Do With Variables?</h2>
<h3>Learning to Use Different Variable Types</h3>

<p>In this task, you will learn to work with the data types and variables. First, initialize a
    basic variable. Type in the following code into the main method: <code>int number = 100;</code> Refer to the
    previous lab if you need help making the main method, or ask for help. Like the previous lab, let’s go through each
    part of the code you wrote.</p>
<ul>
    <li>int specifies the data type you are assigning. Since 100 is a number, you should use int. Although you can use
        other data types like byte, short, and long, int is the most widely used data type to store numbers in Java.
    </li>
    <li>Number is used as the name for the variable. This can be anything as long as it uses letters, numbers, and
        underscores. However, it can only start with a letter. As a rule of thumb, programmers use camelCase to make
        variables easier to read. This means starting off lowercase and then using uppercase to signify the starting of
        a new word. Make sure your variable names are descriptive.
    </li>
    <li>= is just what Java uses to set the value of something. In Java, = is NOT used to check if two things are the
        same value. That task instead falls to the == operator. You will learn more about operators later today.
    </li>
    <li>Finally, 100 is the value that we set the variable called number to. In this case, it is 100, but it can be
        anything within the limits of the integer data type. We follow this with a semicolon to signal the end of the
        command/line
    </li>
</ul>
<p>A cool thing you can do with variables is print them out. Under the variable you created, type <code>System.out.println(number)</code>Notice
    that there are no quotation marks. This is because we are not writing a string but instead just feeding a variable
    into it. Try running the code, and check to see if the output is 100. Ask for help if this doesn’t work correctly.
    Next, try changing the value stored in the number from 100 to any number of your choosing. Check to see if printed
    number changes.</p>
<p>You now know how to create and print a basic variable. However, you can create many more variable types. Try making
    and printing a variable of each type by typing more lines of code underneath the previous. Then show us after we
    finish so that we can check.</p>

<p>Here is a list of all the data types you should make variables for and print to console.</p>
<ul>
    <li>int</li>
    <li>short</li>
    <li>long</li>
    <li>byte</li>
    <li>float</li>
    <li>double</li>
    <li>boolean</li>
    <li>char</li>
    <li>String</li>
</ul>

<p>You should now have 9 lines printed out in console whenever you run the program.If you need help, an example is in
    the hint dropdown.</p>
<div class="hint">
  <pre>
      <code>
String word = “Hello!”;
System.out.println(word)
      </code>
  </pre>
</div>
<p>Remember, if you finish early, ask for a bonus activity, or mess around and see what you can make!</p>
