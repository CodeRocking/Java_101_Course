<h1>Lab 3: Operators</h1>
<h2>What Can You Do With Variables?</h2>
<h3>Learning to How to Use Operators</h3>

<p>In this task, you will learn all of the basic java operators and how to use them.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Addition is done by using <code>+</code> operator. Test this out by defining 2 integers with random values, and
        printing
        your result. Your code should look something like this:
        <pre>
           <code>
int a = 8;
int b = 29;
System.out.println(a + b);
           </code>
       </pre>
        You can also assign the result to a variable and print out that variable like this:
        <pre>
           <code>
int a = 4;
int b = 20;
int c = a + b;
System.out.println(c);
           </code>
       </pre>
        You can also just print out the result like this:
        <code>System.out.println(96 + 42);</code>
    </li>
    <li>Subtraction is done by using the <code>-</code> operator. Test this out by replacing the <code>+</code> operator
        with the <code>-</code> in the
        examples above
    </li>
    <li>Multiplication is done by using the <code>*</code> operator. Test this out by replacing the <code>+</code>
        operator with the <code>*</code> in the
        examples above
    </li>
    <li>Division is done by using the <code>/</code> operator. Test this out by replacing the <code>+</code> operator
        with the <code>/</code> in the
        examples above
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we know how to do basic arithmetic in java let's look at some of the special operators</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        The modulus (<code>%</code>) operation finds the remainder after a division of one number by another.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can assign a value to variable using one equal sign <code>=</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        You can check if to values/variables are equal by using two equal signs <code>==</code> This is a very important
        distinction which
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a list of all the operators we covered.</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>+</code></li>
    <li><code>-</code></li>
    <li><code>*</code></li>
    <li><code>/</code></li>
    <li><code>%</code></li>
    <li><code>=</code></li>
    <li><code>==</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, if you finish early, ask for a bonus activity, or mess around and see what you can make!</p>
