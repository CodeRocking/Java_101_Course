<h1>Lab 1: Your First Program</h1>
<h2>Hello, World!</h2>
<h3>Learning to Print to Console</h3>

<p>Welcome to our Java Course. We are Capital Bots, team #14575</p>

<p>For your first Java program, you will learn to print out something to the console. To do this, type in <code>public
    class HelloWorld{}</code></p>

<p>Writing this line of code specifies the name of the file to the Java decompiler.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Public specifies that any other programs can see the contents of the Java file. This becomes important in large
        programs where many Java files are used
    </li>

    <li>Class specifies that the file being written is in fact a Java Class file. Java Class files just mean that the
        file is filled with code to be run. Although other types of Java files exist, like enumerations and interfaces,
        those are not used as much and are for more advanced programs.
    </li>

    <li>HelloWorld is the name of the Java Class. You can name your Java class whatever you want as long as it only has
        letters, but as a general rule of thumb, capitalize the first letter of every word.
    </li>

    <li>Lastly, the curly braces specify to Java that everything within them is part of the HelloWorld Java Class.</li>
</ul>

<p> Next type in <code>public static void main(String[] args){}</code> in between the curly braces. You should have
    <code>public class HelloWorld{public static void main(String[] args){}}</code></p>

<p>This code is the main method or the part of the program that Java runs when the Java class is run. Let’s go through
    each part of it.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Public once again specifies that any other files can see the contents of the Java method.</li>

    <li>In Java, a static member is a member of a class that isn’t associated with an instance of a class. Instead, the
        member belongs to the class itself. As a result, you can access the static member without first creating a class
        instance. This is kind of complicated and will be explained later in the course. For now, remember that the main
        method always has static in it.
    </li>

    <li>Void specifies to the decompiler that this method will not return anything. This also may confuse you, but we
        will go over methods in more detail later in the course.
    </li>

    <li>Main is the name of the method. Methods can be called anything as long as it only uses letters, but for Java to
        run the method, it must be called main. Again, you will learn more about methods later.
    </li>

    <li>In the parenthesis, we have String[] args. A String is one of the data types which you will learn about today.
        It is just a string of characters combined, hence the name string. The [] part signifies that it is actually a
        string array, which means that it is a bunch of strings combined. If a string is like a word, imagine a string
        array to be a sentence, which is multiple words combined.
    </li>

    <li>Finally, the curly braces signal that everything inside them is part of the main method, meaning they will get
        run.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>You now have a space where you can run code and have it work, but it’s pretty hard to look at. Since things in Java
    are split up by curly braces and parentheses, Java doesn't really care about how long spaces are. This means you can
    format code to make it look better. Try pressing enter after each curly brace to make the code easier to look at. It
    should look like this:</p>

<pre>
   <code>
public class HelloWorld{
   public static void main(String[] args){
       //this is where you enter code
   }
}
   </code>
</pre>

<p>You can also add tabs like we did to make it easier to see what the curly braces contain. In the future, you can
    format your code easily by using an IntelliJ shortcut: Ctrl+Alt+L (CMD+OPTION+L for MacOS). However, not all IDE’s,
    or development environments have this, so don’t rely on it too much.</p>

<p>In the above piece of code, you might have noticed the double slashes followed by “this is where you enter code”.
    This is called a comment. The double slashes signify a comment. A comment is something the decompiler will skip
    over, meaning that the decompiler doesn’t run it. Comments are a good way to add notes to your code. Comments are
    often used as reminders, a tool in debugging, and also explanations of complicated code so that others can
    understand what each line does more easily. In Java, a single line comment can be anything followed by a double
    slash(//), and a multiline comment starts with /* and ends with */, with any text you want in between.</p>

<p>Now, it’s time to write the line of code that allows you to actually print a line to the console. Underneath the
    comment would, type <code>System.out.println(“Hello, World!”)</code> Once again, let’s go through each part of this
    statement.</p>

<ul>
    <li>System signifies that the command is calling the system. In this case, you are using the system to print
        something to console.
    </li>
    <li>Out signifies that the statement is part of the output stream, meaning it is something that sends something to
        the user. In this case, whatever you are printing in console.
    </li>
    <li>Println tells the decompiler to print on a new line. If you want to print on the existing line, you can just use
        System.out.print, but it is not used as often.
    </li>
    <li>The parenthesis tells the decompiler to print whatever is inside. You can put a lot of things inside those
        parentheses like variables and operators, but to print words like Hello, World!, you need to specify to the
        decompiler that you are typing a string, which as mentioned above, is a grouping of characters. Again, you’ll
        learn more about strings today. To tell the decompiler that you are typing a string, just use quotation marks.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Your program is now complete! You can run the program by pressing the play button to the left of the first line of
    code. If you can’t find it or received an error, ask someone for help. If done right, you should receive a message
    saying Hello, World! in console on the bottom of your screen. Make sure it works correctly before moving on.</p>
<p>Let’s check how your code compares to our solution. Press the “Check” button, then compare and contrast the two
    snippets of code by pressing “Peek Solution...”. Next, return here and continue with the exercise.</p>
<p>You can now experiment a little bit. Try changing the words in the quotation marks to your name, and see what happens
    when you run it. As a bonus challenge, try writing some code that displays your name on one line and your favorite
    color on the next line. For example:</p>
<p>Bob</p>
<p>Blue</p>
<p>Only press the hint if you are really stuck.
<div class="hint">You type another System.out.println(“”) statement after the first one!</div>
After finishing, show one of us so we can check it for you</p>
<p>If you got this far, congratulations! You have just finished your first program! Ask for something to work on if you
    have finished early, or try experimenting around with different things.</p>
