<h1>Lab 4</h1>
<h2>Hello, Robot!</h2>
<h3>Learning Object Oriented Programming</h3>

<p>Here is a line by line explanation of the code</p>

<ul>
    <li>Line 1: This line states the programmer's name, beginning with //. The // starts a comment line, which is not
        compiled into bytecode; it is ignored
    </li>

    <li>Line 2-3: The <code>import</code> keyword makes classes in other packages accessible.
    </li>

    <li>Line 5: A class (in Java) is a container for code. This class is public, not private. The left curly brace
        begins the class.
    </li>

    <li>Line 6: All Java programs have a main method. The statements execute in order. The left curly brace begins main
        class.
    </li>

    <li>Line 7: <code>openWorld</code> is a class method in the Display class.</li>

    <li>Line 8: <code>setSize</code> is a class method in the Display class.</li>

    <li>Line 9: <code>setSpeed</code> is a class method in the Display class.</li>

    <li>Line 10: The compiler ignores whitespace.</li>

    <li>Line 11: This line instantiates a Robot object from the Robot class. The object named karel (or referenced by
        karel, or pointed to by karel) is an instance of the Robot class. A class is like a blueprint or a plan for a
        house. An object is like the actual house.
    </li>

    <li>Line 13: <code>move</code> is an instance method in every Robot object. On Line 13 we call the <code>move</code>
        method.
    </li>

    <li>Line 14: <code>pickBeeper</code> is an instance method in every Robot object. On Line 14 we call the <code>pickBeeper</code>
        method.
    </li>

    <li>Line 15: <code>move</code> is an instance method in every Robot object. On Line 15 we call the <code>move</code>
        method.
    </li>

    <li>Line 16: <code>turnLeft</code> is an instance method in every Robot object. On Line 16 we call the <code>turnLeft</code>
        method.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>You can run the program by pressing the play button to the left of the first line of code, you can not use. If you
    canâ€™t find it or received an error, ask someone for help. If done right, you should see a screen pop up and see a
    robot moving on screen. Make sure it works correctly before moving on.</p>

<p>
    Now after the <code>turnLeft</code> instance method call, add code to move forward, and use
    <code>karel.putBeeper();</code> to put a beeper down, then add code to move forward again, and turn around.
</p>

<p>Only press the hint if you are really stuck.</p>
<div class="hint">There is no <code>turnRight</code> and <code>turnAround</code> methods use multiple
    <code>turnLeft</code> method calls to do these tasks
</div>

<p>After finishing, show one of us so we can check it for you</p>

<p>Ask for something to work on if you have finished early, or try experimenting around with different things.</p>
