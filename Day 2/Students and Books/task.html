<h4>Background</h4>

<p>Maps are mapped according to the Cartesian coordinate system. The corner at the bottom-left of the graphics window is
    (1, 1). Maps create the context for solving robot problems. An identifier is the name of a class, an object, or a
    method. An identifier can be any unique sequence of numbers, letters, and the underscore character “_”. An
    identifier cannot begin with a number. An identifier cannot be a Java keyword, like class. Identifiers are
    case-sensitive, so lisa is not the same as Lisa. As a convention, we use camelCase, only class names begin with an
    uppercase letter. Methods, objects, and variables by convention begin with a lowercase letter. Constant values, such
    as EAST, are written in ALL CAPS. The word instantiate means to create an instance of a class—an object. It is like
    saying that you instantiate the house from its blueprints. Java instantiates an object using the new keyword and
    calling the constructor.</p>

<p>The object “knows” how to do things in its methods. We can call or invoke a method, or send a message to a robot
    object, by using dot-notation. For instance, a robot named pete will move forward with the call pete.move();. The
    identifier “pete”, before the dot, is the name of an object and the identifier “move”, after the dot, is the name of
    a method. All methods in Java are marked by parentheses, which sometimes are empty and sometimes have values. The
    pete object will attempt to follow the calls in its move method.</p>

<h4>Specification</h4>

<p>In Lab05.java. Instantiate two Robot objects, one named lisa using the default constructor (<code>Robot name = new
    Robot();</code>) and the other named pete starting at (4, 5) facing south with zero beepers (<code>Robot name = new
    Robot(x, y, Direction, Beepers);</code>). Have lisa pick up the “book” from the math office and bring it to pete.
    Have pete take the book to the storage room and place it on the pile that currently has only two books. Then have
    pete step away from the pile.</p>

<p>Ask for something to work on if you have finished early, or try experimenting around with different things.</p>
