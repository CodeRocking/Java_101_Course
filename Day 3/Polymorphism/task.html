<h1>Lab 8: Polymorphism</h1>
<h2>A Demonstration</h2>
<h3>Sandbox for Polymorphism</h3>

<p>Since you just finished a lecture on polymorphism and we don't have much time in class, this lab is more of a guided demonstration/sandbox.
We have already created 3 classes for you, but you still need to create the objects. In the PolymorphismLab class, create an object of the Animal, Dog, and Lab class. In each of these
classes, we have the same method, and each class inherits from the class above it, but due to polymorphism, each object says a different sound when you call the sound method.</p>

<p>Here is an example of an object of the Animal Class. Do the same for the rest. <code>Animal animal = new Animal(); animal.sound();</code></p>

<p>Try messing around with polymorphism to see what you can make. Feel free to add more classes or more methods.</p>
