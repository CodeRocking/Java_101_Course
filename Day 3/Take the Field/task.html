<h1>Lab 9</h1>
<h2>Escape the Maze</h2>
<h3>Objective: Class methods vs Instance methods</h3>

<p>You may have noticed that Robots don't know how to turn right. In object oriented programming, it is common practice
    not to change the classes that are given to you. Instead, you extend Robot and define the new class which will have
    the power to turn right. Study the structure of Athlete, especially lines 13 to 19. In these instance methods, we
    “teach” Athlete how to turn around and how to turn right.</p>

<p>The keyword extends means that an athlete isa robot. "Isa" means that the Athlete class inherits the behaviors and
    attributes of the Robot class; the methods from Robot do not have to be re-written. We can use turnLeft in our
    definition of turnRight and turnAround, and any athlete object can use any robot method. When you write methods in
    Athlete, think of programming an Athlete in general, not of programming any specific athlete object.</p>

<p>Athlete is a general resource class that will be useful in a wide range of applications. The application called
    Lab08, which has the main method, will use the Athlete class. We sometimes say that Lab08 hasa athlete.</p>

<p>Lines 5-11 are constructors, we will explain this to you</p>

<h4>Instructions</h4>

<p>Open Athlete.java. Implement the methods turnRight and turnAround. Do not run Athlete. Open Lab08.java and use the
    “maze” map at size 8x8. Instantiate one athlete object and direct it to escape the maze. Leave a trail of beepers to
    mark the path. By default, athletes begin with an infinite number of beepers.</p>

<p>After finishing, try implementing a putAndMove method in Athlete, and use it in Lab08</p>
