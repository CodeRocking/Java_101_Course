<h1>Lab 9</h1>
<h2>Take The Field</h2>
<h3>Objective: Inheritance, Writing Constructors and Classes</h3>

<p>A class method conveniently stores code that is accessible to anyone, without first creating an object (the class
    "knows"). Mathematical formulas, such as those in the Math class, are examples of class methods. Often class methods
    control the environments for other objects. You have already seen <code>Display.setSize</code> and <code>Display.openWorld</code>.
    All class methods are marked by the keyword <code>static</code>. Class methods are usually placed before the main
    method, but
    they don’t have to be.</p>

<p>An instance method is a method written in a class that must be instantiated (the object “knows”) before being used.
    Every Athlete should know how to <code>turnRight</code>. Therefore, turning right is appropriately defined as an
    instance method within the Athlete class--the object knows. In contrast, taking the field is something that is
    specific to this lab only. Therefore, taking the field is appropriately defined as a class method within the Lab09
    class. All the athletes in Lab04 will go from the locker room (Point A) to the field (Point B) by executing the code
    in the class method <code>takeTheField.</code></p>

<p>We can use this class method with any athlete object by passing the object. For instance, if we have athletes <code>maria</code>
    and <code>gary</code> defined in main, we can tell each to take the field with the commands:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
takeTheField(maria);
takeTheField(gary);
    </code>
</pre>

<p>Notice that we do NOT say <code>maria.takeTheField()</code>. This is because <code>takeTheField</code> is not part of
    an Athlete object. It is "known" by the Lab09 class. We call <code>takeTheField</code> and pass the object to the
    argument <code>arg</code>, which points to whatever Athlete has been passed; first maria, then gary.</p>

<h4>Instructions</h4>

<p>Open Lab09.java and use the “arena” map at size 10x10. Create six athletes starting in the locker room; use the
    default constructor. Create one object with the 4-arg constructor to put the coach at the side of the field. Have
    your team get positioned for the start of the game as shown</p>
